/**
 * What the bottom bar holds, per position.
 *
 * The bar used to be a fixed five (Dashboard / Tasks / Inventory / Finance /
 * More) filtered by `canView`, which meant a Fashion Designer and an Accountant
 * got the same buttons and both had to dig through More for the one screen they
 * actually live in. Now each `positions.id` in Postgres names the two modules
 * that person works in all day; everything else is reached from the dashboard's
 * quick links or the More hub.
 *
 * Chat is the middle slot for everybody — it is the team's main channel, so it
 * gets the centre position on every layout regardless of role.
 *
 * These lists are a UI *hint*, never a grant: `custom-tab-bar` still runs every
 * slot through `canView`, and Postgres RLS refuses the underlying reads either
 * way. A layout that names a section the position can't see simply loses that
 * button.
