 * The last line of defence for a failed save.
 *
 * Every write goes through `liveWrite`, which throws a `DataWriteError` when
 * Postgres refuses it — an RLS denial, a bad column, being offline. A mutation
 * that rejects with nobody listening used to be invisible: the optimistic
 * update stayed on screen and the person believed it saved. This puts the
 * error in front of them.
 *
 * A mutation with its own `onError` is left alone — a screen that can say
 * something more specific should.
