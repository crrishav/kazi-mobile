/**
 * Live attendance readers: the workshop roll call and the raw GPS punches.
 *
 * The roll call is built exactly the way the reference web app's
 * `Attendance.jsx` builds it, because it has to agree with what the site shows:
 *
 *   roster    every active person in the directory — NOT everyone who happens
 *             to have an `attendance` row. Someone who has never been marked
 *             still belongs on the roll call.
 *   status    today's `attendance` row for that person, or "Absent" when there
 *             isn't one (the reference's `closedDefault`). Never a status
 *             carried over from an older day.
 *   times     today's real `clock_ins` punch — in → out.
 *
 * Everything joins on `person_id` (`people.id`). This module used to group by
 * display name, which was the right call before the Supabase migration but is
 * now the bug: the compat views expose `staffName` as whatever spelling was
 * typed at the time, so one person arrived as two roll-call lines ("Wilson" and
 * "wilson shah", "Sarbagya" and "Sarbagya Karki", "Deepa Sunam" and "Sunam
 * Deepa"), while anyone with no rows at all was missing from the list entirely.
