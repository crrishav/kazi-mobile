/**
 * The signed-in user's own month — the data behind the "Mine" view's calendar,
 * weekly-hours bars and monthly summary. Every figure is derived from live
 * Firestore rows; nothing here is seeded.
 *
 * Sources (all filtered to the signed-in user):
 *   attendance       per-day status, late minutes and the 25%-cut flag
 *   clock_ins        real punches → the actual time between clock-in and out
 *   employees        the rostered shift + `basicSalaryNPR`
 *
 * Hours worked are measured **only** from real punches (clock-in → clock-out),
 * never from the `attendance` row's `hours` field: the web writes the *scheduled*
 * figure there, 8h even on days marked Absent, so summing it invents time nobody
 * worked. Overtime is whatever a day's real punch ran past that day's rostered
 * shift (a whole shift worked on a weekly off counts end to end).
 *
 * The salary deduction is computed exactly as the reference payroll does —
 * `basicSalaryNPR / 30 × 25%` per day marked Late with the cut applied — so the
 * app and the site agree without waiting for payroll to be run.
 *
 * Never throws: a denied rule or a missing profile yields an *empty* month (real
 * calendar shell, zeroed figures) rather than falling back to the mock — showing
 * a real user seeded "168h 40m" would be worse than showing nothing.
