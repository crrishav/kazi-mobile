/**
 * Everything that is not a tab scene pushes here — native-feeling slide from
 * the right, tab bar out of the way, chevron back.
 *
 * ## The `module/` routes
 *
 * Production, Inventory, Finance, Billing, Marketing and Tasks are each
 * somebody's bottom-bar tab, so they also live in `(tabs)`. Two routes,
 * one screen component, chosen by how you got there: the bar switches tabs, and
 * More (or a dashboard quick link) pushes `/module/<name>`. They cannot share a
 * path — a route group doesn't change the URL, so `(tabs)/production.tsx` has
 * already claimed `/production` — hence the prefix rather than a second file at
 * the same path.
 *
 * Before this, a More card for a module that was your own tab jumped to the tab
 * instead: no push, no animation, no chevron, and the bottom bar still there.
 * `useModulePresentation` now decides that from where the screen is drawn
 * rather than from whose tab it is, so the pushed copy gets the back chevron
 * and folds the bar away for everybody.
 *
 * ## Why the JS stack rather than the native one
 *
 * `expo-router`'s default `Stack` is `react-native-screens`' native stack,
 * where each screen is an Android fragment. A pop dispatched from JS — every
 * back in this app is one, because the chevron is our own `Pressable` calling
 * `router.back()` rather than a native header button — removes the route from
 * navigation state immediately, React unmounts its subtree, and Fabric deletes
 * those views while the fragment is still animating out. What slides away is an
 * empty shell: the screen you are leaving loses its content for the whole
 * length of the back animation.
 *
 * The JS stack has no such gap. It tracks `closingRouteKeys` and keeps a
 * popped route rendered until its animation finishes (see `CardStack`), so the
 * card that slides out is still the screen you were reading. Cards are plain
 * views in one hierarchy, which also means `animationDuration` is no longer an
 * iOS-only knob — the timing below applies on both platforms.

// One spec for both directions: the design has a single easing curve, and a
// push that eases out on the way in and differently on the way back reads as
// two animations rather than one movement reversed. `Easing` here is React
// Native's, not Reanimated's — this drives `Animated`, which the JS stack uses.
